Template: envoy-component/fqdn
Type: string
Description: What is the primary Envoy FQDN?
 This is the hostname that will be used for the Envoy component JID, amongst other things.

Template: envoy-component/username
Type: string
Description: What should the username for the primary account be?
 The primary account is the administrative account on the primary FQDN that you can use to manage this server and the FQDNs that are hosted on it.

Template: envoy-component/password
Type: string
Description: What should the password for the primary account be?
 Ensure that this is a secure password.
 IMPORTANT: This account cannot be automatically created, until you have configured Envoy. You should create /etc/envoy/config.json as soon as possible - the first time you run Envoy after doing so, it will create your account. Until then, this password has to be stored in a plaintext file on disk.
