# States

States are constant-like values that indicate the current presence of a
user. State-related methods and variables can be accessed through the
`envoyxmpp.util.state` module.

## Methods

^ envoyxmpp.util.state.from_string(`string`)

	Returns one of the state values listed below, depending on the
	input string.
	
	string::
		A string, according to the XMPP standard, representing
		the desired presence.
		
	### Error conditions
	
	Throws a `ValueException` if an invalid string is supplied (ie.
	not part of the XMPP specification).
	
## Variables

^ envoyxmpp.util.state.AVAILABLE

	Represents the 'available' XMPP presence. This is the typical
	'Online' status with no special attributes.
	
^ envoyxmpp.util.state.AWAY

	Represents the 'away' XMPP presence.
	
^ envoyxmpp.util.state.XA
	
	Represents the 'xa' (Extended Away) XMPP presence.
	
^ envoyxmpp.util.state.DND

	Represents the 'dnd' (Do Not Disturb) XMPP presence, also known
	as 'Busy'.
	
^ envoyxmpp.util.state.CHAT

	Represents the 'chat' (Chatty) XMPP presence. This indicates the
	user is particularly interested in having a conversation. This
	may be treated like 'available' in work environments.
	
^ envoyxmpp.util.state.UNAVAILABLE

	Represents the 'unavailable' XMPP presence, also interpreted as
	'Offline'. Indicates that a user is not currently logged on, or
	that they are not joined to a particular room.
	
^ envoyxmpp.util.state.UNKNOWN

	An extra value that indicates the presence of a user is unknown.
	This does not represent an XMPP presence, rather it indicates
	the **absence** of one.
